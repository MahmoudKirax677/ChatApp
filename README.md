# Real-Time Chat, Video Call, and Coin Purchase App

**Description**:  
This project is a real-time communication application designed and developed over a period of **3 months**. The app allows users to engage in live chat, video calls, and purchase in-app coins for premium features. The goal was to create a **responsive design** with **high performance** across both iOS and Android, ensuring seamless user experiences.

The project integrates **Socket.IO** for real-time messaging and **Agora SDK** for video calls, with an added feature for purchasing coins using various payment methods. A key focus was on optimizing the app's performance and ensuring it follows the best practices for mobile development, including fast state management, smooth animations, and minimal load times.

**Technologies Used**:
- **Flutter**: For cross-platform mobile app development.
- **Socket.IO** (Real-time messaging): For handling real-time chat.
- **Agora SDK** (Video calls): For integrating high-quality video calling features.
- **Firebase** (Push Notifications, Authentication): For managing user authentication and sending notifications.
- **State Management** (GetX): Efficient state management for handling real-time updates.
- **Dio** (API calls): For making fast, reliable API requests.

**Challenges**:
- **Implementing real-time messaging**: Using **Socket.IO** to handle multiple conversations simultaneously with minimal latency.
- **Video calls integration**: Using **Agora SDK** for high-quality, low-latency video calls, ensuring clear audio and video communication.
- **State management**: Managing state for real-time updates and interactions efficiently using **GetX**.
- **Coin purchase feature**: Enabling users to buy virtual coins within the app through secure, optimized payment gateways.
- **Responsive design**: Ensuring the UI is highly responsive and optimized for various screen sizes and orientations.
- **Performance optimization**: Focusing on minimizing load times and ensuring smooth user interactions throughout the app.

**Live Demo**:  
Due to confidentiality, the source code is not available. However, I would be happy to demonstrate the full functionality of the app in a live meeting using a simulator, where you can see the production version of the app running and review its features.
